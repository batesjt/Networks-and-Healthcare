week 7 - wrote research section

Week 8 - created python wrapper for  cpp code provided for MoCHy algorithm for simplicity purposes.
       - Figured out how to go about implementing random hypergraph generation - WIP
       - Started to write pipeline for pulling data from MIMIC and generating hypergraphs in format required 
              for MoCHy
       
week 9 - Essentially restarted and then completed pipeline for pulling data from MIMIC and generating 
              hypergraphs in format required for MoCHy.
       - started implementing random hypergraph generation. Stuck slightly on understanding section of the pseudocode.
